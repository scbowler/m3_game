# Medieval Memory Match Game (*M3*)

### Overview
> This is a simple memory match card game. The player flips over a card then tries to match that card with another card. This is my first coding project that contains JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks are used, not even jQuery. The game board is dynamically created and can have multiple sizes. I even made my own timer, although looking back at it, it wasn't done very well.
